## 2.2 Deploy Webex Webhook

You already know how to send messages to Webex using the bot, however communication with ChatBots does not need to be one way only. To allow you to react to Webex messages sent **to** your bot, you will need a webhook. Simply put, webhook is a reverse API: Webex is sending your server a POST request to let you know about a message, and it is up to you to react to that request.
