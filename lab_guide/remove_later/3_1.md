# 3. Choose your tickets and start deploying more features!

Congratulations, you have quite an extensive event driven prototype created! Now it will be nice and simple to start adding network automation features and to apply what you have learned.

To do this, it is time to select another ticket from the ticketing system and start adding functionalities to your script. Choose one of the following tickets to solve based on your interest and what best matches to a use case you would like to solve in your own environment.
You may complete as many tickets as you have time. There are more ticket options than what you have time to solve during the lab - choose the ones that most resonate on your daily work.
