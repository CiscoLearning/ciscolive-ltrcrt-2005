# LTRCRT-2005 Lab guide

Throughout this lab your will work on solving a support ticket with the help of automation. The first task will make you familiar with Model Driven programmability and set up the script needed for a configuration change. The rest of the tasks focus on adding event driven functionalities to drive those changes.

In the end of the labs, you will have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Take this MVP home after Cisco Live, and following the concepts learned in this lab, start adding more capabilities to answer your network's needs!
